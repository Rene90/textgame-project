# Textgame Project

[Some text that describes, how cool this work is]

## How to install

For running this work you need tensorflow and keras. Further for the
RL environment I use gym and a specific environment called gym-textgame. 
First install gym and then change to the gym-textgame subdir and run
pip install -e .

## Anything else?
